### 🧠 Core Strengths

- **Smart Systems Engineering:** End-to-end design of control systems integrated with IoT, Jetson boards, and cloud services  
- **Predictive Modeling & Optimization:** LightGBM, LSTM, SVM, Decision Trees — used for energy forecasting, fault detection & anomaly prediction  
- **Cloud & Dashboard Development:** AWS (RDS, DynamoDB), Power BI, Tableau, Flask APIs,Next js and data visualization pipelines  
- **AI & Generative Intelligence:** Familiar with LLMs (GPT, BERT), NlP, prompt engineering, and transformer-based architectures

### 🚀 Recent Projects

- **📊 Smart Building Energy Optimization Platform**  
  I developed a cloud-integrated intelligent user interface that implements **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for managing smart building systems, including **ACMV**, **lighting**, and **shading** components. The platform connects with **IoT-based sensors and actuators** and enables facility teams to visualize, monitor, and optimize environmental conditions in real time.
Which includes MPC-based HVAC controller using LightGBM + LSTM for real-time energy and comfort balancing. Connected with AWS, visualized via Power BI.

- **☀️ IoT Solar Monitoring System**  
  Built a real-time system to track and optimize rooftop solar panel performance. Achieved 12% efficiency gains with proactive maintenance recommendations.

- **🔋 EV Battery Thermal Management**  
  Designed a battery simulation model with passive cell balancing and thermal control to maintain SoC and reduce overheating by 4°C.
